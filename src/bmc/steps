1) create the model in python --
2) using bmc to generate a set of counterexamples --
3) use this counterexamples to build a graph --
4) find the transition rates for the graph to convert it to a ctmc (Better to do this in python) (needs work)
5) in PRISM read the ctmc from step 4 --
6) find the probabilty of the ctmc model --
